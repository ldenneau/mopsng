DESCRIPTION

This is an experimental MOPS binary distribution.  It contains a complete
operating environment necessary to run a MOPS simulation.


REQUIREMENTS

Your system must conform to the following:

* Intel/AMD Linux 2.6 or later kernel (any recent RHEL/Fedora, Gentoo, Ubuntu)
* Perl 5.6.8 or later
* Python 2.4 or later
* Mysql 4.1 or 5

In addition, the following Perl and Python modules must be installed on
your system:

Params::Validate
File::Slurp
Config::Scoped
Class::Accessor
Astro::SLA (requires C SLALIB)
Proc::Daemon
MySQLdb (python)


INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Download the tarball.

2.  Create a user 'mops' that will run the simulations.

3.  cd to the mops home directory, then unpack the tarball using

  tar zxcf mops-bindist.tar.gz

4.  Create a ~mops/.psmops_rootpw file that contains the root
password for your mysql database.  You may choose not to do this,
but then you must enter the mysql root password when invoking
buildInstance.

5.  Log in as the mops user.  Then

  + buildInstance --model=1000
  + insertSyntheticFields --filefilt=2006-11 --objfilt=ess
  + mopper
  + effReport --ocnum 84 --type=D | column -t    # derived objects report, OC 84, then format

6.  Enjoy refreshing beverage.


KNOWN ISSUES

* The Apache web interface is not yet supported.  Some hacking of apachectl
is required at the moment to set up the web interface.

* milani_iod is not yet supported in the binary distribution, as OrbFit
requires some path information to be compiled into its executables.
We are still evaluating solutions for creating a bniary distribution
with OrbFit.

* Future versions will not require putting the mysql root password in
a file.  Instead you will be able to specify it on the command line.
