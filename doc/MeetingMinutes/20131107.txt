Attendees: Bolin, Chastel, Denneau, Veres

* Telescope Status
No  report
* IPP Issues
  - IPP Trail fitting
SC: Showed the comments page to EAM (Magnier) http://mopshq2.ifa.hawaii.edu/studies/trailfitting/
  - Convolution
1d-convolution: SC showed results to EAM (test set conv02). EAM: Problem in IPP parameters. Will run new test.
dual: SC processed it http://mopshq2.ifa.hawaii.edu/model/psmops_schastel_conv03/index.html not better but not worse than original results in terms of detections and tracklets see http://mopshq2.ifa.hawaii.edu/model/psmops_ps1_mdrm152/index.html?tjd=6370&proj=h for original data. (Note: Incomplete data for OSS so niot analyzed)
* Data Processing
-> LD: we need validation tests to measure and accept/reject IPP changes
+ define a set of exposures that the IPP will have to process with each new "release"
+ at some point ingest synthetic asteroids to measure the IPP/MOPS efficiency
-> panda failure in PV G96 simulations: LD and SC found where the bug was but it still needs to be fixed.
* NEO Status
-> Bad weather, telescope failure
-> PV will take Micheli's activities for CFHT follow-up. Use astrometry.net software to process the images? LD suggests to use JT tphot for photometry for cfht images.

* NEO Czaring
-> Nothing to report

* Comets
-> No report

* ATLAS
-> Nothing to report

* AOB
->  RJW: pairwise processing of w-band quads - to look for fast moving objects.
  - will need to be czared after the quads
  - recommend that we limit it only to high rate of motion - no pairs presented for < 0.6 deg/day
+ PV/LD/SC: 2 deg/day or more otherwise too many tracklets
+ Use orientation to reject burns.
+ Strategy: link visits 1 and 2, visits 2 and 3, 3 and 4 for sure (maybe later visits 1 and 3, 2 and 4, and 1 and 4 but high risk of mislinkages). Reject pairs which are a subset of a triplet/quadlet previously found. Display in separate page.
-> RJW: comet czaring - can the displayed ranking on the comet czar page be tweaked a little to push higher signal-to-noise objects a little higher.
  - specific case to look at - P1080KW on August 14 UT
  - identified as interesting by our parameters, but buried below low signal-to-noise ratio spurious objects
+ Using s2n will make bright asteroids pop up (and we don't want that).
+ More a question of removing the non-detection detections.
-> LD ingested CFHT smfs but astrometry is not reliable.
-> SC on vacation for the next 2 weeks
-> Marco Micheli left the IfA.
