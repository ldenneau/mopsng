  * 1D-Convolution (SC): no progress

* Data Processing (SC)
- 1 night off because of strong winds (2013-08-25), good weather before (in the bright time), unstable after
- mops10 seems to have memory(?) issues. Removed from the condor pool. Tracklet performs better without it.

- CFHT is back tonight (2013-08-29)
- Object with a geocentric orbit seen last week was artificial

* NEO Czaring (BB)
- Starting the OC
- 47 objects on the confirmation page
- RJW: send only one e-mail at end of processing instead of 2
- RJW: quiet "submit neo button"  => no e-mail sent

* Comets (HH)
- P5. Possibly MBC? Should be followed on CFH.
- P2: Non-cometary object on a cometary (parabolic) orbit.

* ATLAS (RJ/LD/AS)
- Nothing to report on the mops side

* AOB
- SC: Should we have a PS2 item in the agenda? Answer: yes
- SC: TE Efficiency implemented. Efficiency should be moved to mops00
- SC: Last MOPS meeting (in Hawaii) for HH.
- BB: Simulations: observations from anywhere in the Universe? RJ: Atlas does that for locations on the Earth.
