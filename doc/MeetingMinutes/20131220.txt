Attendees: Chastel, Denneau

* Telescope Status
No report

* IPP Issues
  - IPP Trail fitting
No progress.
SC: We should set up intense development/tests with IPP during 3-4 weeks in Jan/Feb.
  - Photometry
No report
  - Convolution/Covariance
SC: Provide new cut-off values for s2n to the IPP(?)

* Data Processing
  - MOPS HW status
     - Buy 2 or 3 of the Processing nodes: Has to be quick (we run on 14 cpus instead of 32)
     - Then replace Database node

* NEO Status
No report
* NEO Czaring
No report

* Comets
No report

* ATLAS
No report

* AOB 
-> Synthetics
    LD: Should we still ingest synthetics? The way they were designed took into account PS4: Are they still significant?
    SC: More a "scientific" concern than an "engineering" one. Should ask RJW/PV
-> IPP extended parameters
    LD: Add IPP extended parameters in the database: det_trailed -> length, pos angle
           Create new database and ingest IPP extended parameters
           -> Even if we don't use them we have them in database and not in fits files...
    LD: Clean exisitng tables (e.g. length, pos is not used in detections)
-> Database performance
    SC: Ingesting mdrm152 on mops00 took 4 days.
    - Use lvm for snapshots and backups (needs exactly same engines)
    - postgresql for future: partitioning?
