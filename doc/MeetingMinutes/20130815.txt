ATTENDING:
Bolin, Chambers, Chastel (chair), Denneau, Hsieh, Jedicke (scribe), Schunova, Sherstyuk, Veres, Wainscoat
MINUTES:
* No meeting last week because of ISS meeting
* PS1 Status (KC)
much discussion on IPP move from MHPCC
PS1 focus is working much better than ever
last few nights has seen 99% images in-focus
* IPP
  * IPP Trail fitting (PV)
PV plans to write a report but hasn't done so yet
trail fitting is implemented but not yet good
pos. angle looks good
but lengths and mags are still not good
untrailed objects appear to be OK
KC requests that it is more important to make report than to worry about it looking good
LD? what about the 'original' set of 100 sample trails
PV is still working on that analysis
  * mdrm137 Ubercal (SC for AF)
Minor concerns with the data. Should be fixed soon
  * Convolution (SC)
SC continues to evaluate the latest IPP convolution algorithms
trying to determine how/whether the MOPS config can be altered to improve detection efficiency
SC sees some skycell border artifacts in the processing 
expects to be done evaluation next week
* Data Processing (SC)
lots of hiccups last week
IPP was reprocessing e.g. M31 which has performance impact on cluster
Grand Reprocessing is also taking place
last night's data not processed yet
mops13 was the target of a denial of service attack last friday
was not successful but still caused problems all weekend
somebody requested 20k stamps! that knocked out MOPS ability to get stamps
MOPS is supposed to get priority but is limited to just 200 stamps per request
SC complained and now has capability to set priorities
SC suggested 2 stamp servers - 1 for MOPS and 1 for everybody else
this request has no response as of yet
IPP will be late in processing for the next 4 months
e.g. might not get data till 2pm in the afternoon
because they are doing some archiving in advance of exit from MHPCC
RW will get involved with reducing these delays


* NEO Status (RW/PV)
doing well this lunation but not as well as last
220 NEOs this year
over 700 total since start of operations
RJ points out that we are supposed to be finding >500 per year
there is one interesting distant object, probably a Centaur
haven't found a PHO is a while

* NEO Czaring (BB)
affected by denial of service and IPP delays
it is admirable that we can do so well at finding NEOs given the problems
SC has created a 'Submit Suspected Comet' candidate button
the button is not a substitute for the MPEC email
i.e. the email still needs to be completed

* Comets
there is a continuing issue with 2013 P2 = 107slc
this is an object on a LPC orbit but has no detectable activity
it was submitted by PS1 but never reported as a comet
it was reported to have coma/tail by amateurs but no activity detected by big telescopes
but it is moving across a messy background
MPC only wants 'suspected comet' if we have good evidence
i.e. *if* MOPS stamps or PS1 analysis shows cometary activity than submit as comet candidate otherwise do not submit
BB wants to know if there is another utility for comets like MPChecker
he says it works 9 of 10 times for known objects
RJ suggests that MPChecker can use a wider search radius to bring in the other 10%
* ATLAS
LD is thinking about making MOPS leaner and meaner
trying to use OpenOrb for ephemeris prediction 
but it is much slower than he expects
would like to implement 2-body ephemerides
BB suggests adopting HG12 system
LD agrees but it should be talked about at another meeting
RJ we have to move to HG12 for ATLAS and PS1/2
AS and LD are creating a full-pass processing pipeline
from synthetic images thru MOPS 
including a postage stamp server
* AOB

minimoons
BB did a little study to investigate minimoon detectability with PS1
he was concerned about the GCR cut eliminating minimoons
he simulated PS1 survey cadence w/ minimoon model
he limited detected rates to <3 deg/day
peak minimoon GCR is at about 0.3" 
PS1 GCR cuts are about 0.5" for slow rates and 2" for fast rates
so MOPS cuts should allow minimoon detection
but detection rate is very low
finding trails and finding faster objects would increase the detection rate
RW wants to review the GCRs for impactors
RJ reminds that BB did a study of GCR vs. distance, etc.
PS2
RJ proposes that new 'PS2 Status' item be added to regular MOPS meeting agenda
Schunova
Schunova's last official workday of employment is *today*
WEKA (data mining environment) online course
SC suggests that this online course might be interesting
