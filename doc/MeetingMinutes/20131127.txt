  - LD: Talked with Erik Christiansen (Catalina). Plan to replace known_server by pre-computed known objects positions. Will save a lot of time.
  - SC: Test Sets Definition. (1) observation conditions: excellent, good, fair, poor, awful => define that thorugh SEEING; (2) must have fast movers (but for poor or awful); (3) galactic / ecliptic latitude? close/not close from galactic/ecliptic; (4) quad vs pairs
Total: ~5*4 = 20 test quads or pairs per filter.
Will work on w first; then g,r,i. Won’t do it for y,z.
