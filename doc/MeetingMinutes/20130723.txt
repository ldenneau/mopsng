* Status of w-band photometry (Fitzsimmons)
looks like mdrm137 w-band is now calibrated
it is chip mags
not all the data is 'photometrically brilliant'
there are still problems in mdrm152
  - strange photometry
  - missing detections
  - looks like a problem on the IPP side
?LD does this mean that we have the mags in-hand?
yes, believable mags and uncertainties
?LD shouldn't uncertainty reflect non-photometric nights?
it does not, but SNR changes with S on non-photometric nights
we need a flag indicating that photometry is good
AF does not know whether the flag exists
until we have a way to identify whether mags are useful the mags are useless
AF will organize meeting w/ appropriate people to discuss how to get the flag and input data into MOPS
* Missing PS1 data (Fitzsimmons)
AF there are w-band exposures in mdrm137 that are not in MOPS from the early survey days
?AF is there a record of what was not processed thru MOPS?
LD in the beginning there were non-standard MOPS databases due to e.g. magic
AF will send LD some exposures that are not in MOPS
* New IPP convolution (Fitzsimmons & Chastel)
IPP has implemented a new convolution that should be better in terms of reducing false positives and finding more real positives
SC has asked for new data from existing OSS field for comparison w/ old data
* Photometric calibration against PS1 catalogs (Meech)
the TAC is not allowing time for calibration images because they claim that all calibrations should come from PS1
but KM asked other PS1 people who claim that PS1 can not yet provide calibrated photometry across the sky
i.e. she wants calibrated stellar mags across the sky
KM requests that 'some one' should write a note that it is not yet available
we agreed that Chambers is the appropriate person to write this note
KM will ask Chambers to write the note
* PS1 telescope status (Chastel)
mirror model was changed last night to improve image quality
IPP trail fitting has been implemented in production
IPP reports that trail fitting is good
MOPS personnel will need to test trail fitting
then implement trail fits in tracklet linking
PV & SC will assess IPP trail fitting parameters
* MOPS processing (Chastel)
no changes, nothing to report
* PS1 NEO status (Veres & Wainscoat)
so far in OC 166 we have 40 confirmed NEO discoveries
4 of them are PHAs
PS1 has 26 more NEOs than G96 for the year
but more than 5 might be shortly announced (depending on follow-up)
this will make the current observing cycle the most successful ever
~13 NEO candidates in OC 166 with digest>95 that were lost
either not followed-up or one-nighters that dropped out of the confirmation site
lost candidates were either too fast, too faint or in pairs (or combined)
RW some objects not found because they weren't where they were 'supposed' to be
2 of the 13 were like this
?RJ losing 13 objects is inconsistent w/ PV's old study showing essentially 100% followup of tracklets w/ digest >95?
PV we are finding more, finding fainter objects, finding faster moving objects
RW future PS1+PS2 will have to do self-followup
PV is creating a tool to make precovery detection easier using OpenOrb ranging
KM has been tasked to write a report for Jim Green (NASA HQ) to assess ground-based followup need/capabilities - PS1 followup will be good motivation 
MSS was rich in new comets
2 are still on confirmation page
KM says Reipurth's VYSOS facility might be employed for high-priority comet followup
* NEO czaring (Bolin)
not much happening now during bright time
BB is training Andrei Sherstyuk (ATLAS)
this weekend may be good as we might get OSS this weekend
SC and PV are scheduled to assist czaring over the weekend
RW thinks MSS is more likely than OSS
RW says MSS has been very productive
* MOPS computing time (Wainscoat)
RW concerned that MOPS may not have enough compute power
RW says single chunk processing still takes 1+ hours
SC solid state drives would improve I/O
SC known_server is slow to load the catalogue
?RJ why isn't the catalogue loaded and retained in memory?
very difficult to modify known_server 
BB suggests using MPCChecker when the # of tracklets is small
PV has some useful code but it does take a long time
there were concerns about overwhelming MPC with requests
known_server also does a lot of quality control
* Comets (Chastel)
2 announced and 2 currently on confirmation page
HH reported that IPP parameters have changed again and this has trickled down to influencing comet page
the difference was a sqrt(2) and IPP knows that it happened but not clear to us why
* MOPS Meeting Times (Jedicke & Chastel)
RJ would like the meeting time to change
sent out a survey but SC is now willing to open up meeting times for the entire week
RJ will send out another survey with more times
* MOPS efficiency studies (Engelhardt & Veres)
TE is fitting all efficiency data from all nights in all filters to the standard efficiency data
note that this is a work in progress and he expects to provide nearly-final results next week
PV points out there is some spurious non-zero efficiency for V>23?
needs to put some more cuts on data that goes into the fits to get only reasonable fits
presented histograms of the max eff (eff0), limiting mag (L), and width of the drop (w)
presented histogram showing error flag frequency
RJ encouraged by results - gets good fits on most nights for which there is data
?RJ will SC include results in MOPS and implement update on a nightly basis?
SC yes
?PV is IPP stellar detection efficiency calculated in the same way?
SC it is available but not in MOPS products
SC thinks it would be good to have both available
RJ it is possible to imagine studying IPP eff(V) vs. MOPS eff(V) when available so that eff(V) could be evaluated on a per field or chip basis
* Synthetic detection processing thru IPP (Chastel)
requests assistance in developing comparison tests
SC will talk to PV
PV says IPP mag comparisons will change with rate of motion
* Subaru image processing (Bolin)
continues to work on developing this capability
