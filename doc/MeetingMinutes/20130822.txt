ATTENDING:
Veres, Chastel, Engelhardt, Hsieh, Denneau, Jedicke (scribe), Wainscoat, Bolin
MINUTES:
* Telescope Status (KC)
no report
* IPP
  * IPP Trail fitting (PV)
no progress
LD reminds everybody that trail fitting has been an IPP requirement since the beginning of PanSTARRS
  * mdrm137 Ubercal (SC for AF)
calibration mostly done for 3pi
w-band for 152 might be another 1-2 months
MD fields won't be available for a long time
  * Convolution (SC)
not had the time to evaluate 
* Data Processing (SC)
IPP delays continue due to imminent cluster move
IPP is particularly late today because one of the nodes was on fire!!!
MOPS is still missing some data/footprints from last friday
seems to be related to high detection density in the galactic plane
SC & LD are investigating and trying to find a way to eliminate or reduce the problem
* NEO Status (RW/PV)
PV discovered geocentric object in PS1 data!!!
he was looking for precovery of a submitted tracklet that was not recovered by others
detailed search found one more tracklet
detections are trailed (5 deg/day) with obvious light curve modification
detection position angles changed within a detection!
even 4 detections w/ 2 day arc provided good enough orbit
now followed up by Slovak colleague
now MPECed as 2013 QW1
PS1 imaged the location last night but we are waiting for IPP
RW reports that he found 3 detections last night
RJ showed Lockheed Martin movie using preliminary (guess) orbit
  - see https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33273427/P1087SO.wmv
    (not a long term file!)
note that findobj *works* for geocentric objects because findobj integrates orbits
PV will run findobj asap
RW and MM verified that object was probably not seen in earlier PS1 images
very high inclination so manages to be not where PS1 is imaging
RW suggests getting Gemini DDT
RW if this object is more common than expected than maybe more of our tracklets are like this

* NEO Czaring (BB)
not much to report because of bright time
there is a lot of backlogged recovery from just prior to bright time
followup is being complicated because of reduced availability of megacam

* Comets (HH/JK)
2 comets found in the past couple weeks
neither have been CBETed yet, maybe because they are waiting for more observations?
'Comet' P2 will be undesignated as a comet
HH suggests discussion for bright time comet followup
RW: Tholen has more time on the 88" and maybe some could be scheduled in brighter time?
* ATLAS (RJ/LD/AS)
Armin Rest is visiting ATLAS to teach how to use photpipe
expects within 1-2 weeks to be able to show image processing from images to asteroid detections with stamps shown in MOPS
ATLAS uses PV's ATLAS survey strategy, injects real stars and asteroids directly into the image
* AOB
IPP rejection flags: SC created a tool to determine why detections are rejected. SC is investigating why some detections are rejected even though there are no flags
OTIS DB: RW reports that this DB no longer appears to be available
Toni's Efficiency: SC not yet implemented
TE suggests using LD's algorithm if it is better
LD suggests using the R script
SC will make the call once he evaluates the issue
digest scores: not yet fixed for manual added detections
