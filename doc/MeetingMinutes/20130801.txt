MINUTES:
* Telescope Status (KC)
things are in relatively good shape
there has been a little degradation from bad focus but they think they can get it fixed soon
they had shut down everything due to Flossie
probably prudent given all the lightning

* IPP Issues (while KC is in)
  * Trail fitting (PV)
showed figs of IPP fitted trails
it seems like measured 'width' of untrailed objects with trail fitting is about right
but 'length' of trail is strange
  - PV's original code had length=0 corresponding to untrailed object
  - IPP code seems to have length=1 for untrailed object
PSF flux of untrailed objects does not match trailed flux of untrailed objects
there is ~-0.4 mag offset at zero motion
KC: need to determine if PV's code has the same offset
  * Photometry issues (SC for AF)
good photometry seems to happen when ZP>25.98
AF has provided email description and SC will forward to ps-mops-dev
80% of IPP data is ubercaled
if data is photometric and ubercaled then photometry is good
otherwise treat photometry with suspicion
it will take 3 years to get photometric conditions on every sky pixel
RJ? are the uncertainties trustworthy?  i.e. do they reflect real photometry
not known, should be studied by DRAVG
  * 1d convolution (SC)
IPP/Waters produced new convolution data for test study
total tracklets decreased 90%!
still needs to investigate how it impacts efficiency

  * Dual convolution (SC for AF)
AF is investigating results
neither of the convolutions are currently in production mode
IPP is waiting for MOPS to decide whether to 'pull the trigger'
KC thinks the data looks much better (by eye)
RJ reminds that if the false detection rate really goes down the actual detection efficiency with the current parameters might also go down - but this OK
the current cut parameter space needs to be explored to find new 'best' thresholds
SC is currently only looking at a couple different fields, needs to test different filters, conditions, etc.
KC recommends a more aggressive iteration to better parameters to find more NEOs
SC a little more cautious, informed decision to be made by SC w/ RW & AF

* Communication with the IPP (while KC is in)
KC would like all tickets to be managed in the PS1 management system
SC wants to have clear communication channels that are well defined
IPP tickets can only be closed by the group/person that opens them

* Data Processing (SC)
problems with processing last night's data
currently processing

* NEO Status (RW/PV)
there were about 10 objects from last lunation MPECd with only F51 + one other observatory
PV is working on automating precovery of NEOs
he has submitted about half a dozen objects that were missed by F51
we need to know what they were missed
he is currently unable to submit them as precoveries
initial stats:
* detections in MOPS but no tracklet created! (has not yet determined why tracklet was not created)  SC will investigate
* no detections in MOPS db, need to investigate if the were found by IPP

* NEO Czaring (BB)
not much happening due to weather, mechanical problems, bright time

* ps-mops / ps-mops-dev mailing lists
SC has not been using a mailing list
SC says LD abandoned use of the mailing lists
SC will begin maintaining the lists

* Comets
no report, no comets found recently
one definite comet on the CP now has large ephemeris uncertainty (3 deg)
it is in the MSS

* MOPS efficiency studies
TE provided his latest automated fits to all nightly MOPS *detection* efficiencies for all filters  i.e. the efficiency for identifying detections in IPP+MOPS
TE & PV suggest that the width values might be fixed at say 0.25 mags
we will do study to check
SC suggests that a study could be done looking for correlation between PSF & width
good idea but probably too complicated
SC will implement code in MOPS
and make it updated each night
might want to set upper limit for eff0
SC thinks implementing figs would also be useful for czar to assess data
TE will provide documentation
TE will provide code to SC

* ATLAS
w/in weeks ATLAS sw should exist to generate synthetic images at each ATLAS footprint w/ real stars and asteroids that are then processed thru a proto-IPP and proto-MOPS

* AOB
-condor_wait problem
ES and PV have been constantly having problems with MOPS simulations failing
they have to restart w/o difficulty but it is hassle
SC thinks he may have a clue about what is happening
SC will get together with PV to investigate the problem
