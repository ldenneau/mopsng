Tony Engelhardt (TE), Peter Veres (PV/scribe), Richard Wainscoat (RW)

AGENDA:

* PS1 status: Telescope, IPP, MOPS data czaring (SC)
  - nothing new since last week: bad weather, IPP delays (pixels
    servers were moved to a new switch operating only at 100 MB/s
    instead of 1GB/s, nebulous node failed)
  - w band photometry (Alan Fitzsimmons) issues, will be discussed on
 Skype on Friday morning 8:30 am (HST), with Alan, Gene, ...
  - trail fitting: no progress (IPP)
  - trail fitting: PV altered the code (to provide additional parameters
  and to use input parameters from the tracklet), SC will implement it
  and add ellipse to the jpeg as an overlay ds9 region (ellipse is
  based on trail fitted parameters)
  - convolution: no progress (IPP, Mark)

* NEO status (RW, BB or PV)
  - we lost 4 high scoring NEO candidates (score 100) due to high rate
  of motion, faint, UH2.2 had technical issues, CFHT did not have
  wide-field imager (full moon), posted on NEOCP, nobody did the
  follow-up.
  - attempt to do the self-follow up of P107mHT the next night, did
  not find it (PV searched for MOPS detections with expected PA and
  length by moments and IPP trail length), expected v_tot~30 deg/day
  at 19.8 mag. PV thinks that the IPP S/N too low to be detected.
  - 10,000th NEO discovery (PS1)

* NEO czaring (RW, BB or PV)
  - 3 objects from pairs that we are not sure they are real submitted
    to NEOCP, we follow the NEOCP if someone confirm them (some of
    them had crosstalk flag, but the shape and motion look
    realistic). All at relatively high declination (40 deg). Sometime,
    the false pairs are aligned with a position angle and rate of
    motion. PV has an idea to display histogram of PA and v_tot for
    pairs interface. RW suggested to talk to IPP (Chris) and
    investigate crosstalk options for these candidates.

* Comets: Template, AOB (HH or JK)
  - nothing new

* IPP Synthetics (SC)
  - work in progress (SC), will need details on what statistics we
    need from synthetics

* Replication of production databases to neohq1 (SC)
  - TE requested access to the production database (for mdrm152 and
    mdrm137 data), concerns about the security and privileges,
    replication in progress (SC)

* Power outages in Manoa on Thursday (Jun 27th) and Saturday (Jun
  29th) (SC)
  - concern about the MOPS cluster: batteries for CMOS, 
  - czaring will be disturbed

* AOB
  - We need to change naming of chunks (A, B, C), tessellations,
    should be ecliptic-based. This will be needed as we go toward more
    observing time (RW).
