    * Jan 18-22. We reached 1b detections: Overflow in Known server. LD takes care of fixing.
RJW: Start a new database?
LD: Better by the end of February so that we donâ€™t have 3PI anymore
    * IPP References needed: reprocess the same set of exposures every day to see differences from one day to antoher.
    * OSS: maxv limited to 5 at the moment
    * BB: Should we make OSS Pairs and Quads?


* NEO Status
  - CFHT back
  - Cooperation with Catalina for the even/odd RA stripes

* ATLAS
Almost entirely automated.  Looking at fields close to opposition.  Tracking NEOs brighter than 17.


* AOB
  - Stamps
    -> SC wrote a script to fetch them directly from the IPP cluster
    -> SC: Wire stamp script into the web page for 1k stamps
    -> SC: Use getfits? WCS tools package
    -> SC: Tell the IPP team about it
  - RJW: Use findOrb?
    -> LD: Provide specs and openOrb will likely do it
