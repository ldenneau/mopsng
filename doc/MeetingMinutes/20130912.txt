Attending:
Bolin, Chastel (chair/scribe), Denneau, Jedicke, Veres

Mnutes:
* Telescope Status (SC)
Bad weather, camera problems but fine.
* IPP
  - IPP Trail fitting (PV)
PV: If trail pixels length>10, position angle is good. Tested on 10,000 longest asteroid trails (all bands)
PV: Position angle is ok for objects moving faster than 0.5 deg/day.
PV: The lengths are often off leading to poor magnitude estimates.
JD/LD/SC: How good is it compared to PV's IDL code? When not trailed can we know reliably about it?
-> Need to build a reference set of trailed detections. Provide a report to IPP based for testing with ground-truth data (namely a table with exposure name, band, psf quality, ra, dec, asteroide name, flux (estimated by IDL), length, position angle).

  - Photometry (AF)
No report
  - Convolution (SC)
No progress
* Data Processing (SC)
- no more SYNTH stage: can't estimate the speed-up because of no data
- mops04/mops10: memory tests; swapping tests. Apparently no problem on these hosts. SC will try to add them back to the Condor pool at some point.

* NEO Status (PV)
- nothing much to report (bad weather)
- Follow-up: cfht down since Tuesday (bright time); 88 off or half-time operated

* NEO Czaring (BB)
- nothing to report
- silent/quiet button still required
- nice detections of L2

* Comets (JK)
Nothing to report
* ATLAS (LD)
- mops working on the atlas cluster (mops installation was painful: jpl python extension installation failed)
- atlas will largely use GO (google language)
  SC: Need to evaluate if GO can run on the mops cluster.
* AOB
  - Searching detections in IPP smf (SC)
smf_search on mops14. Grab smf files from the IPP, give the nearest neighbors from a ra,dec position
  - New MOPS meeting time
New time for MOPS meeting: Tuesday 11am.
