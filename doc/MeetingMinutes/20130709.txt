* PS1 Status / Data Czaring (SC) 
- very good weather, actually causes problem close to GP, hard to do astrometry because so many sources 
- SC asked EM, EM says star catalog near GP is not robust enough in w-band to do astrometry
- IPP: MH still looking at convolution issues, in most cases "fine", some cases don't work  -
CW also looking at convolution as well. PSFs modeled as linear combination of Gaussians, but finding single Gaussian works well; some data was reprocessed and published to datastore, see Chris's report as well 
- LD: has convolution really been listed as a KP1 priority? Why not wrap up trail fitting first, then work on convolution?

* NEO Czaring (BB)
- BB: g-band seems to have problems with sources appearing/disappearing 
- unclear whether these are crosstalk/reflection artifacts 
- LD suggest somebody (Serge) post something to NEOCP blog indicating they are processing artifacts

* NEO Status (PV and then RJW)
- still chugging, couple PHAs & comets since last mtg 
- MSS starts tonight

* Comets (HH by e-mail)
- Blanpain
- RW: 2 candidates are not comets probably

* Production databases replication (SC)
- replication of production MOPS DBs on neohq1 
- efficiency data (for Toni) available since Feb 2011 
- want eff0 and L values stored per night in DB

* Bugs reporting and evolutions for MOPS (SC+LD)
- Use Bugzilla for enhancement  / evolution / bug report

* AO(S)B
- BB: Please notify BB if you are away during czar commitments
