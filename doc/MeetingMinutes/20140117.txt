Bright time not too overwhelming. 3 on the CP.

- 20% of stamps missing

* Comets
- BB: See last week
- RJW: Create a tool to query our comets and get info/statistics about them.
- BB: No follow-up of P109CWR with CFHT. Need to get it when CFHT has Megaprime back on

* ATLAS
- Observing every night on Mauna Loa
- they would like to start to see bright NEOs - please advise them if you know of suitable targets


* AOB
  * New observing plan (RJW)
- Starts Feb 1st (Same plan till Jan 31)
- 11% on e.g. odd nights; 100% on e.g. even nights
- ipp0022.ifa.hawaii.edu/ps1sc/denneau/173/hammer.html (show: oss w)
- OSS stripes 1h wide, e.g. OSS.R02N1 => RA between 02 and 03 hours, North 1 (up to N7)
- Cooperation with Catalina continues
- i band when the moon is up and bright enough
- there might be a few z band observations but only quads
- the tessellation needs to be modified and rerun to extend down to -40 - LD is exploring this
- we plan to cover areas twice per month to start with, and this will produce some self-followup
- Present staffing may not be enough for NEO review/followup
- MSS and ESS will still be observed
 * Lindley Johnson and possibly Tim Spahr may visit at the end of February
 * We would like more open access to the IPP
