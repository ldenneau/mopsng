# mopsng - Next-generation Moving Object Processing System

## DESCRIPTION

This project is a spin-off of the Pan-STARRS Moving Object Processing System (MOPS),
employed by the PS1 telescope to find asteroids in the PS1 data stream.  MOPSNG is
a slimmer version of MOPS that attempts to reduce the large requirements footprint
of the original MOPS and to focus on the most-used features of MOPS, tracklet creation
and survey simluations. Various other flavors of the PS1 MOPS have been successfully adapted to
the NEOWISE survey, the ATLAS Project and LSST.

## REFERENCES

An excruciatingly thorough description of the Pan-STARRS Moving Object Processing System can be found in [Denneau et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7281).

MOPS uses synthetic asteroid populations for its simulations.  [Grav et al. (2011)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PASP..123..423G) produced a full-scale synthetic solar system for early Pan-STARRS simulations.
