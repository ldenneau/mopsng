# mopsng - Next-genearation Moving Object Processing System

## DESCRIPTION

This project is a spin-off of the Pan-STARRS Moving Object Processing System (MOPS),
employed by the PS1 telescope to find asteroids in the PS1 data stream.  MOPSNG is
a slimmer version of MOPS that attempts to reduce the large requirements footprint
of the original MOPS and to focus on the most-used features of MOPS, tracklet creation
and survey simluations. Various other flavors of the PS1 MOPS have been successfully adapted to
the NEOWISE survey, the ATLAS Project and LSST.
