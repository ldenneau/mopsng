IPP forgot to implement the 30 JUN 2012 leap second, and as a result,
all MJDOBS are reported one second earlier then actual.  This is true
only for exposures observed between 56136 < epoch_mjd < 56241 (MOPS
night numbers 56135-56239 inclusive) that were processed before 09
NOV 2012 UT.

Need to generate a script to update all detection epochs, as the std
SQL takes too long.
