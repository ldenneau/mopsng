Attempt to ingest an SMF file by extracting all the detections, stationary
or not, and executing findTracklets on the input set.  Our hope is that
by invoking findTracklets with a lower rate limit, we will in effect
find all transient detections of inner solar system objects.

Ideally we would like to identify out SS transients, but this will
require a bonafide star catalog to identify stationary sources.  Even more
ideally, this filtering would be performed upstream by image processing
so that the SMF catalog contains only transients.


For each chip in SMF, create list of detections with 

ID numeric chip num (e.g. 01) and chip det_num, sprintf("%02d%08d", chip_num, det_num)
EPOCH_MJD can be artificial, but must have accurate deltas across the SMF quad set
RA_DEG
DEC_DEG
FOM figure of merit, 1/PSF_QUALITY


OUTLINE

1. Perform stationary filtering to reduce detections by ~75%
2. Ingest remaining detections
3. postclean each field to remove linear artifacts and clumps
