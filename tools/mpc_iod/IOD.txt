HELP INFORMATION FOR IOD (Updated 2008 Mar. 24)

Usage:

   IOD [flags] < [observation file] > [elements file]

Version 13 of IOD supports the following optional command-line flags
(some of which have relevance only for debugging purposes):

-quitpass=n Quit after pass n of the orbit solution code.  Passes are
            numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4.
-all        Output all orbit solutions found.
-strict     Suppress additional book-keeping information beyond the epoch
            on output orbits.  Additional information is: r.m.s. residual
            in seconds of arc; number of observations; observed arc in
            days; flag to indicate which routine generated the orbit;
            orbit number; total number of orbits; up to three flags (H = 
            large scatter in H values from observations, U = unusual
            orbit and S = suspicious orbit); uncertainty in H.
-onesol     Output only one orbit solution per object.  Omitting this
            flag will cause additional orbits to be output if multiple
            solutions exist.
-badh[=]    Output orbits with large scatter in H determination to
            BadH.<runname>.  As on option, you can specify a value above
            which orbits will be flagged.
-runname=<runname>  Name the log and statistic files.  If omitted, log and
            statistics files are named *.txt. 
-logfile    Output LogFile.<runname>, containing statistics on the run.
-statfiles  Output various log files: ZeroSol.<runname> contains a list of
            objects for which no orbits were obtained; and MSolution.<runname>
            contains a list of objects for which multiple orbits were
            output.  The file MSolution.<runname> is not created if -all 
            is selected.
-statfiles= Output various specified log files, as a comma-separated list.
            The options are zero and multiple, for ZeroSol.<runname> and
            MSolution.<runname>, respectively.  The file MSolution.<runname>
            is not created if -all is selected.
-done       Create file done.<runname> when IOD finishes.
-nocalc     Scan the observations file, but don't calculate any orbits.
            Also sets -logfile.
-quitnum=   Don't calculate any more orbits after the given number: e.g.,
            "-quitnum=100" only calculates orbits for the first 100
            objects and then quits.
-debug      Switch on debug mode.  Best used only for troubleshooting
            small numbers of objects as a *lot* of output is generated.
            Also sets -logfile and -statfiles.
-config=    Specify location of config file.  Values specified in config
            file override hard-coded values in program or specified via
            environment variables or -defile/-helpfile flags.  Use caution
            when using this option to override hard-coded default values.
-defile=    Specify location of DE405 datafile.  Overrides MPCIOD_DATA
            environment variable.
-helpfile=  Specify location of this help text.  Overrides MPCIOD_HELP
            environment variable.
-version    Display IOD version information.

Log and stat files are created in the current directory.

The order of the command-line flags is not important.

Flag names must not be abbreviated.


Config file format:
  Entries consist of a keyword, an equals sign and a string or numeric
value.
  Configurable keywords are as follows (they take numeric values unless
otherwise specified):

MaxTNOMotion  Values of the daily motion <= specified value are treated
                as distant objects, i.e., Jupiter Trojans and beyond
                (default = 0.12 deg/day).
MaxdHV        Values of H scatter greater than specified value cause orbit
                to be flagged "H" (default = 0.6 mag.).
MaxRMS        Residual r.m.s. greater than specified value during orbit
                computation cause orbit to be rejected (default = 0.20").
MaxMVRMS      Residual r.m.s. greater than specified value during MV orbit
                computation cause orbit to be rejected (default = 0.20").
SuspRMS       Residual r.m.s. greater than specified value in orbits
                accepted for output buffering cause orbit to be flagged
                as "S" (default = 0.10").
UnusualRMS    Residual r.m.s. greater than specified value in orbits
                accepted for output buffering cause orbit to be flagged
                as "U" (default = 0.08").
defile        Full pathname to DE405 datafile (string).
helpfile      Full pathname to this help text (string).

Keywords are not case-sensitive.  Comment lines, if desired, begin with
"!".  Non-comment lines lacking an "=" or value are ignored.
